# What to add to my code reviews - Notes

- early detection of errors
- check for completeness
- check for functionality/acceptance criteria
- sufficient tests
- decentralized
- foster contribution/collaboration
- peer learning (juniors/seniors) - mentoring
- should have at least 2 reviews before merge

- work in shorter periods of time/take breaks (max 60min)
- do not review >500 lines/h - take your time
- set goals (indicate in the code where and what shd be reviewed)
- remove peer to peer stigmas (e.g. not built here)

- automate trivial checks
- reach consesnsus
- ask instead of telling (you don't know what you don't know - compromise)
- concrete review requests
- focus on algorithms (what about performance...?)

- look for security, functionality and performance problems
- review(er)s steps: 1st the actual coder shd review
- critique the code not the coder (be kind to the coder and not to the code)
- checklist

- level up code reviewing
  - prioritize goals for code review (e.g. catch bug? understand the way each other think?... think about what is the goal of one particular review) (concrete take away)
  - use the app/ the perspective of the user to review (detect problems)
  - set up a timeframe (do them immediately)
  - copy to another repository / work in isolation (read code in a realistic environment)
  - always aprove unless you can prove / trust team mates - believe they know what they are doing (general take away)
  - imagine your own solution before reviewing
  - make visual representations/diagrams (figure out/understand) what their code is doing (concrete take away)
  - every team or person is different (general take away)
