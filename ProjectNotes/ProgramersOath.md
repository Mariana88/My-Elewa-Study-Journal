# My thoughts on the oaths

* First oath
 * define harmful
 * the need to think about potential harmful use of your code in technology

* Second oath
 * write the best code you can (aka "have some shame for bad code"). Don't write stuff you know is bad.
 * what about cost-benefit ?
 * what about dealing with the stupidity of human kind?

* Sixth oath
 * why is higher productivity necessarily the better? Add some humanitarian and green mentality to that

* Seventh oath
 * why do we need to be a team?
 * no one is irreplaceable
